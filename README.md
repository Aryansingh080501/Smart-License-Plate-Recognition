# üöó **SmartLicensePlateRecognition**

## **Overview**  
SmartLicensePlateRecognition is a cutting-edge machine learning project designed to identify and read vehicle license plates from images and video streams. Leveraging the power of **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)** for high-precision object detection and **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for text extraction, this system offers a seamless solution for various practical applications.  

The extracted license plate numbers are efficiently stored in a database for easy access and further analysis.  

### **Applications**  
- Intelligent traffic management  
- Automated parking systems  
- Electronic toll collection  
- Surveillance and law enforcement

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**  
- **High-Performance Detection:** Robust license plate localization under diverse conditions (lighting, weather, etc.).  
- **OCR Integration:** Extracts alphanumeric details from detected plates.  
- **Real-Time Compatibility:** Processes both live video streams and static images.  
- **Custom Dataset Training:** Easily train the detection model for region-specific license plate styles.  
- **Database Support:** Automated storage of plate numbers for enhanced record-keeping.  
- **Platform Independence:** Deployable on Windows, Linux, or cloud infrastructure.
